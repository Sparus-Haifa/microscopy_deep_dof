# Deep Depth-of-Field for Microscopy On-The-Go

## Here we publish the files in order to reproduce our results which we published in our paper **"Deep Depth-of-Field for Microscopy On-The-Go"**.
- In the folder **ZEMAX** you can find the OpticStudio ZEMAX files for our imaging system.
- In the folder **"Matlab"** you can find the related matlab script in order to create the kernels for the needed focal planes and their out of focus planes.  
In order to run the matlab script it needs to be able to execute the ZEMAX optimisation process. 

- In the folder **"Checkpoints"** you can find our checkpoints for our trained model for the network published in "Scale-recurrent Network for Deep Image Deblurring". In this folder are the checkpoints for our model trained without noise and with noise.
